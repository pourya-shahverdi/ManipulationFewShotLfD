Welcome to the **Nao Learning From Demonstrations** repository! This project integrates robotic control, machine learning, and simulation environments for real-world and virtual robotic tasks. From motion prediction to grasping and pushing simulations, this repository provides all the necessary tools and scripts.

## **Project Overview**

This repository is organized into several modules and folders, each designed to handle specific aspects of robotic control and simulation:

- [**KinectSkeleton**](./KinectSkeleton/README.md): Processes skeleton data captured from Kinect sensors for motion mapping.
- [**Notebooks**](./Notebooks/README.md): Jupyter notebooks for training machine learning models.
- [**PostProcessing**](./PostProcessing/README.md): Prepares and cleans datasets for training and evaluation.
- [**RealWorldScripts**](./RealWorldScripts/README.md): Integrates models and robotic control for real-world tasks.
- [**Simulation**](./Simulation/README.md): Scripts and scene files for simulating robotic interactions in CoppeliaSim.
